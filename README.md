# Greg's Home Directory Dotfiles

This is my personal collection of dotfiles.

Currently the only thing that is specific to me personally is the `.gitconfig`, which obviously has
my name, email, and GPG signing key ID.

Feel free to fork this repo and use for your own dotfiles.

## Installation

- Clone this repo somewhere. I always have a `~/git` directory, so I end up cloning to
  `~/git/dotfiles`.
- Run `./install.py`, or `./install.py -f` if you are ok with existing dotfiles being replaced.
